The following CSS code snippet has an uncommon error that can be difficult to debug:

```css
div {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: red;
}

.container {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  background-color: blue;
  margin: auto;
}
```

This code attempts to center a blue square inside a red square. However, due to the way `margin: auto;` works with percentage-based widths and heights, the blue square might not center perfectly.
